Red Boy is the son of Princess Rakshasi, who was impregnated after being forced to drink from the River of Child-bearing following her husband's decision to join hands with Sun Wukong. Though Red Boy was close to his mother, he never truly considered the Bull King as his father, seeing him as weak to have submitted to the Celestial Court despite the suffering they caused his mother. When Wukong's party requests for his mother's fan to proceed in their journey, Red Boy adamantly refuses in contrast to Princess Rakshasi's willingness to lend her fan.

This, in turn, results in him being beaten by Wukong and inevitably drags his mother into conflict as she turns against Wukong after her son's treatment. Following his defeat, Red Boy became a disciple for Bodhisattva Guanyin and became an acquainted with the Black Bear Guai, another disciple that had been subdued by Wukong previously. One day, Black Bear Guai would receive an important request from the Celestial Court. Although he did not know what is was for, Red Boy wished to accompany him for the task, but Black Bear Guai politely refused and departed from Guanyin's domain.

Like Black Bear Guai, Red Boy left his discipleship with Guanyin and reverted back to his old self, returning home with plans to take his revenge on his defeat from Wukong through the Destined One.
