Black Bear Guai was an acquaintance of Elder Jinchi since his days as a child before he became the abbot of Guanyin Temple. When Jinchi got into conflict with Sun Wukong and the Tang Monk, the Black Bear Guai found himself involved and was defeated by Wukong before pledging himself to the Bodhisattva Guanyin and wearing a divine headband similar to Wukong's. During his discipleship under Guanyin, he asked why Jinchi was so obsessed with the Tang Monk's golden robe, to which Guanyin replied that without such robes, how would anyone know that Jinchi was a monk.

Years later, Black Bear Guai would be among the old enemies of the monkey king that were employed to subdue him by the celestial court. As a reward for this, Black Bear Guai was gifted Wukong's eyes. Blessed with this new relic, Black Bear Guai abandoned his discipleship and reverted to his old ways, returning back to the Black Wind Mountain near the remains of Guanyin Temple.
