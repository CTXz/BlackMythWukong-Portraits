From Field of Fire's Fallen Furnace Crater Shrine, just proceed forward and a cutscene will start that will lead to a fight with Red Boy. Once he is defeated, he will transform into Yaksha King.

If the Destined One doesn't land a finishing blow for a few seconds, while he and Yaksha King are on a very low Health (both are near death), the fight will immediately end with an extended cutscene. In the scene, the two will exchange blows and the Destined One will use Cloud Step to avoid a fatal blow and then defeat Yaksha King. The cutscene then proceeds the same after Yaksha King is defeated and falls on his knees.

Upon its defeat and completing Chapter 5, you will obtain Plantain Fan, Celestial Ribbon, Fine Gold Thread, Gold Tree Core x2, Kun Steel and Mind Core.
