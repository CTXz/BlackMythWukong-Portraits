The elder tiger and his brother were orphaned at a young age following their father's death at the hands of Sun Wukong's party. Although their life was harsh, the pair worked together and eventually managed to govern the Yaoguais in the area, leading to a newfound peace. Grateful for this, the villagers worshipped the elder tiger as the mountain's deity and built the Crouching Tiger Temple in his honor, providing him and his brother with much tribute.

The life of peace was not to last as the Yellow Wind Sage, the lord of the brothers' father, had returned after taking the head of Bodhisattva Lingji. At his brother's urgings, the pair joined together to fight Yellow Wind Sage, but their combined might was not enough. The younger brother was knocked unconscious, and the elder brother was forced to surrender in exchange for his brother's life. Yellow Wind Sage would give the elder brother his father's title of Tiger Vanguard, but his decision to join Yellow Wind Sage severed his relationship with his younger brother, who cursed the elder and fled.

Now a lieutenant for Yellow Wind Sage, Tiger Vanguard is allowed to reside in Crouching Tiger Temple, where his tally leading to sage's quarters is guarded fiercely, and he is kept full with an endless supply of rat guais to eat. Despite his new allegiances, Tiger Vanguard only remains loyal to Yellow Wind Sage out of survival and holds him responsible for his family's sorry state.
