Kang-Jin Loong was one of the many constellation deities alongside the Dawnstar, and left to aid Wukong's fight against Yellowbrow. Following Wukong's death, Dawnstar would mysteriously disappear, and the released Yellow Brow was suspiciously having a new banquet. Believing that Yellowbrow had something to do with Dawnstar's disappearance, Kang-Jin Loong infiltrated Yellowbrow's banquet but was captured instead.

Unlike before, no one would come to her rescue, and Kang-Jin Loong languished as Yellowbrow attempted to break her will. When Kang-Jin refused to surrender, he sucked her inside his seed sac, where she found Wukong's Hubris Nose. In disbelief, and being misled into thinking that Yellow Brow had subdued both Wukong and others of his power, Kang-Jin finally knelt and submitted to her enemy.
