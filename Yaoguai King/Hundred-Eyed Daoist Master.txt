The Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master was among the many former enemies of Sun Wukong that were assembled by Erlang Shen to defeat and kill Wukong. For his service, the Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master received the Envious Tongue and returned back to his former domain. Now armed with his new relic, the Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master exacted revenge on those that previously aided Wukong against him, severing the left and right hands of Bodhisattva Pilanpo, and easily defeating her son, the Dawnstar using the Bodhisattva's Weaver's Needle.

Gruesome experiments would await as the Hundred-Eyed Daoist poured an experimental potion that either killed or corrupted the Dawnstar, turning him into the Duskveil, and eggs implanted into the left and right hands of Pilanpo emerged as grown Yaoguais. Though the Crane Immortal tells the Hundred-Eyed Daoist off as the court had only chosen not to immediately intervene, the Daoist Master remained comfortable with the position he crafted for himself.
