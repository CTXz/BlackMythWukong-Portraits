Yellow Wind Sage was one of Sun Wukong's old enemies that was previously defeated. After being spared by Bodhisattva Lingji, Yellow Wind Sage participated in the Celestial Court's attack on Sun Wukong, and was gifted Wukong's ears. With these new powers, Yellow Wind Sage took revenge and decapitated Bodhisattva Lingji before taking his rat guais back to retake Yellow Wind Ridge. His only true resistance would be sons of his old lieutenant, Tiger Vanguard, but both were dealt with easily. The younger brother was knocked out and later fled, while the elder brother surrendered and joined his ranks.

Yellow Wind Sage soon took control of the entire valley as his Samadhi Wind polluted the nearby areas like Sandgate Village and his rat guais and stone guais overran the rest. Having finally returned to power, Yellow Wind Sage would hide behind special gates with requiring two tallies from his best vanguards.
