Elder Jinchi was the head abbot of Guanyin Monastery, one of the early stops of the Tang Monk and Sun Wukong during their journey. As a child, Elder Jinchi became acquainted with the Black Bear Guai and eyed the flashy robes used by the older monks during his apprenticeship. As he eventually grew to become the head abbot, Jinchi regularly collected and viewed kasayas. Jinchi's own robe contained a black bear, in honor of the friendly guai he had previously encountered.

One day, he received the Tang Monk and was enthralled by his golden robe. Claiming that his eyes were not clear, Elder Jinchi asked to borrow the robe for the night. As he marveled in its splendor, Jinchi's latent greed reemerged when he tried to wear the cloak. A fire soon erupted in the temple, and, knowing that his greed was the root cause, committed suicide.
