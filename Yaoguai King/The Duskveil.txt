A final boss encounter with the two-phase transformation, Blood Moon General. This boss is enormous, and the protagonist can only engage in battle by standing at its feet. It can unleash area-wide attacks, making dodging these attacks a challenge. Additionally, during its second phase transformation, the entire scene is shrouded in a blood moon, and its attack patterns undergo some changes.
