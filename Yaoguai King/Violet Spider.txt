Violet Spider was once a heavenly maiden that met Zhu Bajie, then-Admiral Tianpeng and fell in love at first sight. After the admiral's fall from grace, the Violet Maiden, either due to her desire to follow or for other reasons, followed him into the mortal realm as he had reincarnated as a hideous pig guai, while she became one of the spider guai sisters. By coincidence, after she and sisters capture the Tang Monk, she is reunited with Bajie after he sneaks into their bath.

Bajie's presence, however, causes her sisters to inform their minions, and Bajie escapes before he returns with Sun Wukong and Sha Wujing to chase off the guais. When Wukong fought against the Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master, Bajie was instructed to kill the Violet Spider and her sisters. Though he killed her sisters, Bajie was unable to bring himself to kill the Violet Spider, and she was allowed to escape.

In the years that followed, the Violet Spider remained in the Webbed Hollow, having given birth to six daughters in the meantime. Together with her daughters, they would often prey on male visitors, guai or otherwise. When the Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master returns after the defeat of Sun Wukong, he would pass a special needle for the Violet Spider to use in his next plan.
