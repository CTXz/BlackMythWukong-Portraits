Lingzhi (灵芝, Ganoderma) is a genus of polypore fungi in the family and are used in traditional Asian medicines. Ganoderma was mentioned in Zhang Heng's (张衡; AD 78–139) Xijing Fu (西京赋).

In Chinese mythology, everything has the potential to give birth to wisdom, the chance to become a "spirit"(精怪, Guai), and the faintest hope of becoming an immortal. They are not initially good or evil, and their nature is usually determined by their experiences.

In the concept art on the right, Lingzhiling is armed and looks evil. This may be related to the plot of "Black Myth".
