When passing through the Forest of Felicity's shrine, a corpse can be found near the gate with a peculiar snow fox pelt. The snow fox is revealed to have formerly been a fox guai that had hoped to repay the kindness shown by a scholar that saved it from a trap but was killed by same scholar. Now left with its lingering emotions, the snow fox gives the Destined One its Snow Fox Brush and asks for vengeance against its killer.

He can be found in the New Thunderclap Temple. From the Temple Entrance Shrine, go through the centre temple in front of you, then head left up the stairs. Keep going straight and then go down the stairs on the left leading to the side temple where Ma Tianba can be found. Head up the stairs on the right, you should see a balcony with 2 enemies. Head through the doors across from them and up the ramp, follow the stairs just slightly to the left all the way up into the shrine room. Continuing this path will eventually lead to Non-Void, who is non-hostile when spoken to. If the Destined One then uses the Snow Fox Brush, Non-Void immediately becomes hostile and attacks them. There will be a secret cutscene if the Destined One is already transformed before approaching Non-Void.

After his defeat, the player can then return to the corpse near the Forest of Felicity, and the Snow Fox Brush will be transformed into a Curio for them to equip.
