Ma Tianba must first be spoken to in a small cave  of Bamboo Grove (more precise locations below), he warns the Destined One not to accept any of the Black Bear Guai's offers. After finishing his entire dialogue, he moves to Sandgate Village and has been imprisoned by the local rat guais. He can be found near the gong close to Earth Wolf's location, asking for the player's help. Upon Earth Wolf's defeat, he will thank the player and promises to eliminate any more rats before he escapes and returns to his own journey.

In The New West, Ma Tianba can be found in New Thunderclap Temple's side temple. Here, Ma Tianba has been able to speak with the local Buddha and is thankful to now be able to live for himself as he plans to return his king. Despite this, trouble occurs when he is captured by the spider guais at Webbed Hollow and is encased in a silk sac near Centipede Guai's arena. After being freed, Ma Tianba states that he'll be returning back home to the Flaming Mountains.

Ma Tianba's journey would come to a saddening end as his spirit has been stripped from his body, his body transformed in puppet by the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains while his spirit is forced into the broken cart of the Furnace Valley. After returning to him from defeating the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains, the dying Ma Tianba gives his whip to the Destined One, gifting them with the Dark Thunder Transformation before he passes away.
