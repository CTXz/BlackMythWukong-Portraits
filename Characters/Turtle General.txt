Turtle General was among many of Wukong's previous allies, alongside Snake General, that had helped him defeat Yellowbrow. After Wukong's death, Yellowbrow returned to New West and began stirring trouble once more. Both Turtle General and Snake General learned of this and attacked Yellowbrow, but Yellowbrow unleashed both a Ten-Tailed Goldfish and the Apramana Bat to engage the generals on water and land respectively.

The four were evenly matched, but the situation changed when Yellowbrow dropped a blanket of snow on the Bitter Lake. Because of their natural instincts, both Turtle General and Snake General became drowsy as their bodies entered a hibernating state, and Turtle General was powerless to stop Snake General's eventual death at the hands of Yellow Brow and his minions.

Turtle General would be left in a vegetative state at the Bitter Lake, having little hope following the death of his friend.
