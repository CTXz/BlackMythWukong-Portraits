Rakshasi is the wife of the Bull King. Following her husband's decision to aid Sun Wukong's rebellion against the Celestial Court, Rakshasi is forced to drink from the River of Childbearing, becoming pregnant with Red Boy. Rakshasi would confide with the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains of the pain she had to suffer from bearing an unwanted child. Despite this, Rakshasi remained a loving mother that Red Boy treasured as he grew to resent his father.

When Wukong's party arrives asking for Rakshasi's plantain fan for their journey west, Rakshasi sees trouble for refusing and agrees to lend her fan, but Red Boy flatly rejects this and attacks Wukong's group. After Red Boy is beaten, the enraged Rakshasi would refuse to honor her previous promise, and this leads to another fight that ends with her being beaten, the Bull King's mistress being killed, and her fan being taken by force.

After her defeat and her fan's return, she moves back to the Flaming Mountains and initially saw a return to her peaceful life as her husband, now converted to Buddhism and more serene, and Red Boy, having concluded his discipleship with Bodhisattva Guanyin, coming back home. Alas, the life was not to last as the Bull King became depressed after helping the Celestial Court kill Wukong. Despite her efforts, her husband continued to grow more feeble as her son's volatile nature grew increasingly unstable.
