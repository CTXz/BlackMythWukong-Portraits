The Third Prince is located in a cell near the Destined One's when he is first transported to the Pagoda Realm. Initially, a purple magic has sealed the cell door, meaning that he can only be spoken to from outside the cell. Once Captain Lotus-Vision is defeated, the Destined One can enter his cell to speak with him directly.

If the Destined One had found the shack where a Two-Headed Rat Guai was hiding in Sandgate Village, the same Rat Guai can be found in the cell with a sword on its chest. The Third Prince states that he was forced to kill his subordinate as an act of mercy due to the maddening influence of the Pagoda Realm. This Rat Guai can then be absorbed for the Ashen Slumber transformation.
