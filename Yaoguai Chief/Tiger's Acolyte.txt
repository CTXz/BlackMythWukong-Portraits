Tiger's Acolyte was formerly a warrior that settled down in Sandgate Village with his new wife and child. When his wife succumbed to illness from the harsh desert wind, and his son became close to following, the man became desperate to search for a cure. His only hope seemed to be dashed when the bodhisattva had gone missing.

While passing through a dry well, the man heard a roar and entered the well and found Mad Tiger, weakened from his battle against Yellow Wind Sage and still in recovery. Mad Tiger posed as his elder brother and claimed to be the mountain's deity, who could cure his son's illness. In exchange for the man luring in other villagers to be consumed by Mad Tiger, his son could consume medicine from the Tiger's special gourd, which helped rejuvenate his condition.

The villagers eventually found out that the man had led their neighbors to their deaths and beat his son to death. When the man returned to the scene, he took his sword and slaughtered the village before leaving into the desert.
