The Fourth Sister can first be encountered in Webbed Hollow's The Venture Bridge. When approaching the treasure room, she will kill the talking lanterns and inform the Destined One that she heard of there having treasures.

Later, she appear again when finding the purple talismans and expresses her frustration with them. From The Verdure Bridge, cross the bridge and take the right path. Drop down two times and turn left. Go uphill to where the tree is and turn right going uphill again. Continue and cross the wooden bridge and the first purple talisman will be ahead on the right. After she leaves, remove it.

The second purple talisman is in Cliff of Oblivion. From the shrine turn around and it will be straight ahead in the water.

The third purple talisman is in Relief of the Fallen Loong. From the shrine, turn around and go right into the cave. Then take a left and go around the hole, and then uphill. At the top, you can find the third talisman.

The fourth purple talisman is in Temple of Yellow Flowers's Court of Illumination. From the shrine, continue forward up the stairs and it will be in the middle in the next area.

Once the talismans are removed, the Supreme Celestial Inspector will arrive. After a brief fight with him, he will overpower the Destined One, however Crane Immortal will arrive and tell him to spare the Destined One. Crane Immortal will then state that no matter how many times he reincarnates, he is still blind to the ways of the world. Crane Immortal states that the Destined One gets in the way of the Court and gives The Fourth Sister a false hope. He also states that he will transform her into a golden pill and keep it for him, so he should think about her, when he reincarnates again. After that, the Crane Immortal leaves.
