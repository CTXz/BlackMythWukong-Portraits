Fiery tails upon its forehead,
Preying by the mountainside.
The skilled one shuns the wars it dreads,
The unskilled roars with reckless pride.

The Sage Stone Monkey, with his inherent wisdom, learned the ways of human manners and speech during his travels across various realms and later achieved mastery of the Dao at Mount Lingtai. Setting aside his natural endowments, let us now examine his later pursuits in enlightenment.

When he left in a huff at Yingchou Stream, the Old Loong King reasoned with him, and he returned to admit his mistakes. He abandoned arbitrary actions and always heeded sound advice.

He forged brotherly bonds with yaoguais, engaged in jest with immortals, and exchanged banter with Bodhisattvas. His amiable nature endeared him to all, who were ever willing to offer their assistance. He had a sense of decorum and propriety.

He had the ability to summon wind and rain and could seek out loongs. He could transform into guais for scouting or borrow vessels when needed. In times of trouble, he sought the aid of higher beings, seldom relying on brute force.

This Feng-Tail General, with multiple eyes on his head, had a keen understanding of both himself and his enemies. He was adept at leaping and dodging, avoiding powerful foes whenever possible, and displayed a touch of the monkey's cleverness. It's no wonder that the crown on the monkey's head grasped his nimble thoughts so well.
