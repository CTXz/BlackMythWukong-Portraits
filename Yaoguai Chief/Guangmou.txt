Guangmou was once a disciple of Guanyin Temple alongside Guangzhi as they both served Elder Jinchi. Despite his own talents, Guangmou was immensely jealous that Jinchi always acknowledged Guangzhi but not him. When the Tang Monk and Sun Wukong arrived to visit the temple, Guangmou noticed that Jinchi had abandoned his own teachings and became obsessed with his guest's golden kasaya.

Enraged by his master's hypocrisy and seeing Guangzhi encouraging Jinchi's greed, Guangmou schemed to eliminate the two of them by encouraging Guangzhi and Jinchi to murder the Tang Monk and take the kasaya. On that night, Guangzhi set fire to the Tang Monk's quarters, but Guangmou summoned wind that quickly spread the fire throughout the entire temple instead. As he had hoped, Guangzhi fled to the mountains while Jinchi, filled with grief and guilt, committed suicide.
