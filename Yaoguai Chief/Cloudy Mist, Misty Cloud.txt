From the Furnace Valley's Valley Entrance Shrine, continue forward. After a while you will start going uphill and will go through two big torii-like gates. After the second, you will be in a big area where Cloudy Mist and Misty Cloud will appear.

Upon their defeat, they will drop Knot of Voidness, Fine Gold Thread and Cold Iron Leaves x2. They will also drop their Spirit.
