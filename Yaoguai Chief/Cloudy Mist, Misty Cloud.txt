Let the strange be strange, the odd be odd,
Follow the boy master, let mountains fall in chaos.
Flaunt neither strength, nor take pride,
When disputes come near, cast them aside.

Once upon a time, there were three yaoguais who shared a single body. They aspired to earn the title of a mountain deity and thus, with their bribe paid, they targeted at a blind mountain deity of Mount Hao to take his place.

Although the mountain god was blind, his hearing was exceptionally sharp. He was highly skilled in the art of smoke and fire, able to release smoke to conceal his movements. Whenever the three yaoguais came to provoke him, he would immediately vanish into hiding.

One time, the three yaoguais combined their powers to emit a sweeping flash of lightning, forcing the mountain deity out of hiding. The mountain deity cried out, waving his incense sticks wildly. The three yaoguais, being clumsy, couldn't dodge and got hit. Seeing their clothes catch fire, the three yaoguais forgot about the mountain deity and started blaming each other.

As they quarreled, a burst of laughter echoed from the cliff. A young boy with red skin and white hair sat there, watching them as if enjoying a show.

Embarrassed and angry, the three yaoguais and the mountain deity temporarily set aside their differences and attacked the young boy. The boy, finding it amusing, wielded a sharp spear and sparred with them.

Unexpectedly, the mountain deity's smoke perfectly concealed the clumsy body of the three yaoguais, while the yaoguais' lightning provided opportunities for the mountain deity to attack. Together, they managed to fight the young boy for several rounds. It wasn't until the boy used his Samadhi Fire that they fell to the ground, begging for mercy.

Then, Red Boy told them, "From now on, these six hundred miles of mountains are mine. You will follow me and become my captains."

From then on, the three yaoguais were given a new name, "Cloudy Mist", and the blind mountain deity was named "Misty Cloud". They continued to serve Red Boy as a team, but their deep-seated animosity remained unresolved, leading to frequent quarrels that persisted to this day.
