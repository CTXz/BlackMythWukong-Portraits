Before becoming a monk, Non-Void was a traveling scholar. One day, the scholar found a fox that was wounded from a hunter's trap and rescued it. While sleeping for the night, the scholar dreamed that the fox transformed into a woman. The pair eventually fell in love, and the fox bore his son. His son would grow into another successful scholar and became wealthy before returning home with the scholar's new grandchildren. The blissful life was cut short when the scholar returned to find blood on his doors. To his horror, the fox reverted back to its bestial form and killed both their son and their grandchildren.

Haunted by this dream, the scholar killed the fox and skinned it before returning to his journey. During this time, he became one of Yellowbrow's disciples, but his killing of the fox left a hole in his conscience that would continue to shadow him throughout.
