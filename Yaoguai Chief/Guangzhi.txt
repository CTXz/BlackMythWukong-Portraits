Guangzhi was a wolf guai that wanted to live as a human and subsequently transformed himself in their form to learn their ways. Guangzhi was sent by the Black Bear Guai to learn under Elder Jinchi, and he was able to learn the basic skills of reading and writing. When Jinchi begins fawning the Tang Monk's golden kasaya, Guangzhi innocently concocts an extreme plan of killing the Tang Monk to seize the robe. This plan is encouraged by Guangzhi's fellow disciple, Guangmou, but in reality, Guangmou was jealous of Jinchi's fondness of Guangzhi and angered by the head abbot's greed.

During the night, Guangzhi set fire in the Tang Monk's quarters hoping to burn him and take the kasaya. Unfortunately, the plan backfired in the worst way as the monk was protected from the fire, and a wind summoned by Guangmou in secret had successfully spread the fire through the entire temple. Jinchi took his own life, and the Black Bear Guai, the only other person he could turn to, had been forced to submit to the Bodhisattva Guanyin after stealing the golden kasaya during the temple's fire.
